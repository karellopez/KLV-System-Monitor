# KLV-System-Monitor

KLV System Monitor is a lightweight, cross-platform system monitoring tool
written in Python with PyQt5 and psutil. It provides a modern, customizable
interface inspired by the Ubuntu system monitor, while adding advanced features
for efficiency, flexibility, and user control.

Recent updates reduce the monitor's own CPU usage by batching per-process
information retrieval and disabling graph antialiasing by default.
